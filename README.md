### Context  
The repository contains Python packages to reconstruct and analyze muography data recorded at La Soufri√®re de Guadeloupe, an active volcano located in the French Lesser Antilles. The volcano is monitored by the Volcanological and Seismological Observatory of Guadeloupe (OVSG), under the responsibility of IPGP. 
The detectors used in this study are scintillator-based hodoscopes named 'muon telescopes' developed in IP2I, Lyon. 
The data processed by this package were acquired in the framework of the ANR DIAPHANE and ANR MEGAMU projects.  
  
### Data processing steps  
## 1. Tracking:  
To process raw telescope data and reconstruct particle track event-by-event, the user needs to run ```python3 tracking/main.py``` with the following arguments:    
INPUTS:  
    - ```--telescope [-tel]``` (str2telescope) the telescope name (required): Check the available telescope configurations in  dictionary ```dict_tel``` in ```telescope/telescope.py```.  
    - ```--input_dat [-i]``` (str or List[str] or ```.txt``` file) :  /path/to/datafile/  One can input a data directory, a single .datf file, or a list of data files e.g ```--input_data <file1.dat> <file2.dat>```.  
    - ```--out_dir [-o]``` (str) : /path/to/outdir/ where the output directory will be created.  
    - (optional)```--input_type [-it]``` (str, ```DATA``` or ```MC```) either real data or monte-carlo data  
    - (optional) ```--max_nfiles [-max]```  (int, default is ```1```) the maximum number of data files to process.  
    - (optional) ```--is_ransac```  (bool, default is ```True```)  
    RANSAC parameters:  
    - (optional) ```--residual_threshold [-rt]```  (float, default is ```50```mm, i.e size of detector pixel)  
    - (optional) ```--min_samples [-ms]```  (float, default is ```2```) the size of the inital data sample  
    - (optional) ```--max_trials [-mt]```  (float, default is ```100```) maximum number of iterations to find best trajectory model  
    - ...  

OUTPUTS:  
    Two dataframes with event id index:    
        - ```reco.csv.gz``` : RANSAC output (intersection points XY coordinates between fitted trajectories and each telescope panel) for each filtered track.  
        - ```inlier.csv.gz``` : inlier and outlier XYZ points coordinates and their associated charge content in X and Y (in ADC)  

## 2. Reco  
Once the processing output is here, you can run the ```reco/main.py``` script to get panel hit XY maps and DXDY maps with the following arguments:  
INPUTS:  
    - ```--telescope [-tel]``` (str2telescope)  
    - ```--in_dir [-i]``` (str) : /path/to/output/tracking/  
    - ```--out_dir [-o]``` (str) : /path/to/output/dir/  

## 3. Muography (2D)     
For a given telescope edit ```files/telescopes/<tel>/run.yaml``` file with reco data paths for calib (open-sky run) and tomo datasets (see step 1.); then run ```muo2d/main.py``` to estimate acceptance, flux, opacity, mean density.
INPUTS:  
    - ```--telescope [-tel]``` (str2telescope)  

OUTPUTS: 
    - Acceptance estimate : saved as binary pickle file format ```acceptance.pkl```
    - Flux, opacity, mean density estimates : saved as binary pickle file format ```flux.pkl```, ```opacity.pkl```, and ```mean_density.pkl```
